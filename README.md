# The Exercise is to do some coding and compilation/Execution of codes
## Exercise 1
Here we where told to Write a function that checks whether the number in an array (list or tuple) is even.
The difference between a list and a tuple is that they are both used to store element(items) but the list stores items that canbe removed, added or editted at anytime but with tuple onces the items are stored they can't be changed ,edited or removed

### Exercise 2
In this code a customer has a 20% discount is he/she spends above 10.000frs and the customer has an extra 5% discount if he/she pass the loayalty program.
But if the customer is not part of the loyalty program and did not spend above 10.000frs a service charge of 5% is applied.

#### Exercise 3
Here we have to Rewrite the code snippet below using the match case statement,
Note that a match case statement offers a powerful mechanism for pattern matching in Python.
    In this code the function checks if status_code = 404. We will use a match-case statement to compare the value.
    If match 404, it goes to case 200: and it prints the given condition and it continues so until it reaches case: 500. But if no condition are met then it goes to case null and prints "print(f"Unknown status code: {status_code}")"






###### Exercise 5
Given the following for loop below, modify the code to achieve the same result using a while-loop
Therefore we will modify code so we can include while-loop
Here's the main while-loop "while index < len(favorites):".
And the output prints all the other fruits as favourite desert.

####### Exercise 6
Using a nested for-loop, print the 2 and 3 multiplication tables:
And here's what we got as output 
Multiplication Table for 2:
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20

Multiplication Table for 3:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
As required.
